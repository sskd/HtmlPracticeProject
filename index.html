    <b>Subject of study</b> <br>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the 
    subjects fall some where in the realm of science and technology. You seem and intelligent, dedicatec researcher, and just 
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as 
    follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ul>1. Turing H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</ul>
    <ul>2. Measuing the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
           exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</ul>
    <ul>3. <u>HTML</u>and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</ul>
    So please can you provide more informantion on each of these subjects, including how long you'd to know? Thanks.
